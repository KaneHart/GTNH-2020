Terrain is generated by RTG which generates a significantly smoother terrain.\n\n? We disabled the following from spawning on the OVERWORLD: villages (villagers can still be cured from zombie villagers), dungeons, temples, caves, ravines, abandonned mineshafts, strongholds, lava lakes. This signifanctly improves client FPS and server TPS. It also prevents ore veins from being ruined by caves/structures.\n\n? We removed all chest based loot in the Overworld. This was done to give all players a level playing field no matter when they start.\n\n? No user placeable portals. Access to the Nether, Twilight Forest and The End will require going to one of our Bunkers (more info lower down).\n\n? We do not have any (non-admin) teleport commands and prefer players use other transportation methods like rail. We have also disabled the very cheap Witchery Waystones.\n\n? The world has a border at 16,000 in every direction (world is 32,000 x 32,000 in size).\n\n? Harvestcraft gardens do not spread. The world is very large and you can also purchase them from the quest coin shop.\n\n? The world has temperate bands (the North is cold, South is hot and the middle is temperate). This does affect where biomes are placed.\n\n? Chunkloading is only available through the use of Railcraft\u0027s Personal and Passive anchors.\n\n?Gliders can NOT be used in the Overworld, Twilight Forest or the Nether.\n\n? Beds are only used to set your respawn point. Day night cycle is 20 minutes long.\n\n? We disabled some of the more OP Infernal mob traits.\n\n? Full \"changelog\" is available on our github."
