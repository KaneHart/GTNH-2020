### DefaultQuests.json Disabled Quests (Just Locked Behind Highest Item):


The idea here is to set any quests we don't want showing hidden behind preRequisites ```308```. This is the quest where you earn a Zero Point Module. This normally just use for junk quests like how to set rwg settings on a server, etc.


This is a much easier system to update, etc per new version then having to edit / replace parts of quests especially since these are dedicted to nothing we want or need...
 

We might steal 1 quest for Server Rules / Info!
