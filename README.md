# Stone Legion 2020 GTNH Server Changes & Client Additions!

## Why the Changes? 

Simply put we don't agree with all the changes that are made so we customize a few things on both the server and client that we feel are more fitting for our community. That being said we don't force the requirement of having our client side at all (you will be able to join our server with the stock client).

## When will the server be up?  

First Quater of 2020. We don't have an exact date as we still have to purchase hardware, do testing and cofiguration for the launch. 

## What will the server Specs Be?

Still under development. But we are planning the following:

- AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 3.8 GHz 12-Core Processor
- Asus Prime X470-Pro ATX AM4 Motherboard
- G.Skill Aegis 64 GB (4 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory
- XPG GAMMIX 2TB S11 Pro 3D NAND PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 R/W up to 3500/3000MB SSD
- Corsair VS 650 W 80+ Certified ATX Power Supply
- Rosewill RSV-R4100-4U Rackmount Server Case/Chassis - 8 Internal Bays
- As well as Backup Sata Mechanical Drive for longer term backups.
