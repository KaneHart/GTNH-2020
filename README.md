# Stone Legion 2020 GTNH Server & Client Changes!

## Why GregTech New Horizons in 2020?

Pretty much it comes down to the most simple thing ever. GTNH is one of the best Modpacks that continues to be updated and worked on as we speak. Minecraft 1.7 Might be 7 years old, but this pack is always feeling fresh and always constantly being updated with new content. That is why we decided to start a fresh server in 2020 with new hardware and using the latest 2.0.8.0+ Update. Just to give you an Idea this was the Patch notes for 2.0.8.0 / 2.0.8.1: https://gist.github.com/KaneHart/b0cff63c6789cb6d69819a0be5b54cd5
That is right they added an entire new mod made for GTNH... That is the kind of amazing things you see. 

# Why Changes?

We want our server to be a bit more unique and not giving out free loot, etc. Most of our tweaks are minor and we don't mess with the progression, quests, etc. We just tweaking a few things like world gen, loot tables from chests, etc. We want to offer a more balanced and enjoyable server that everyone has a more fair and equal start. We also sometimes might nerf the functions of early game travel like the hang glider that can cause a lot of performance impacts and also removes the enjoyment of other methods of travel like Trains.

## When will the server be up?  

First Quarter of 2020. We don't have an exact date as we still have to purchase hardware, do testing and configuration for the launch. 

## What will the server Specs Be?

#### Still under development. But we are planning the following:

- AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 3.8 GHz 12-Core Processor
- Asus Prime X470-Pro ATX AM4 Motherboard
- G.Skill Aegis 64 GB (4 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory
- XPG GAMMIX 2TB S11 Pro 3D NAND PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 R/W up to 3500/3000MB SSD
- Corsair VS 650 W 80+ Certified ATX Power Supply
- Rosewill RSV-R4100-4U Rackmount Server Case/Chassis - 8 Internal Bays
- As well as Backup Sata Mechanical Drive for longer term backups.
