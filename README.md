# Stone Legion 2020 GTNH Server & Client Changes!

## Why GregTech New Horizons in 2020?

Pretty much it comes down to the most simple thing ever. GTNH is one of the best Modpacks that continues to be updated and worked on as we speak. Minecraft 1.7 Might be 7 years old, but this pack is always feeling fresh and always constantly being updated with new content. That is why we decided to start a fresh server in 2020 with new hardware and using the latest 2.0.8.0+ Update. Just to give you an Idea this was the Patch notes for 2.0.8.0 / 2.0.8.1: https://gist.github.com/KaneHart/b0cff63c6789cb6d69819a0be5b54cd5
That is right they added an entire new mod made for GTNH... That is the kind of amazing things you see. 

## Why Changes?

We want our server to be a bit more unique and not giving out free loot, etc. Most of our tweaks are minor and we don't mess with the progression, quests, etc. We just tweaking a few things like world gen, loot tables from chests, etc. We want to offer a more balanced and enjoyable server that everyone has a more fair and equal start. We also sometimes might nerf the functions of early game travel like the hang glider that can cause a lot of performance impacts and also removes the enjoyment of other methods of travel like Trains.

## What major things did you actually change?

- We removed most chest based loot in the Overworld. This was done to give all players a level playing field no matter when they start.
- No user placeable portals. Access to the Nether, Twilight Forest and The End will require going to one of our Bunkers (more info lower down).
- We do not have any (non-admin) teleport commands and prefer players use other transportation methods like rail.
- The world has a border at 8,000 in every direction (world is 16,000 x 16,000 in size).
- Harvestcraft gardens do not spread (Performance Reasons). The world is very large and you can also purchase them from the quest coin shop.
- Chunkloading is only available through the use of Railcraft's Personal and Passive anchors.
- Gliders can NOT be used in the Overworld, Twilight Forest or the Nether.
- Beds are only used to set your respawn point. Day night cycle is 20 minutes long.

## No portals? Bunkers?

We wanted to encourage players to explore the world, make paths to each other and construct railway networks. We chose to disable players being able to create portals so that they need to go to one of the 9 bunkers placed in the world where they can venture to the Nether, Twilight Forest or The End world. These bunkers will be fairly evenly layed out. Players can deposit a specific item to open a stargate to a bunker on another world (only to the Nether, Twilight Forest and the End). The return journey back to overworld requires no payment through the bunkers.
