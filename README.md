# Stone Legion 2020 GTNH Server & Client Changes!

## Why GTNH in 2020?

Pretty much it comes down to the most simple thing ever. GTNH is one of the best Modpacks that continues to be updated and worked on as we speak. Minecraft 1.7 Might be 7 years old, but this pack is always feeling fresh and always constantly being updated with new content. That is why we decided to start a fresh server in 2020 with new hardware and using the latest 2.0.8.0 Update.

# Why Changes?

Most of our changes are slight changes, some client configs, maybe a loot table nerf and world gen change here and there. Were not changing the packages recipes, etc. Just closing a few early game loop holes that we feel gives the game fair start. Also might add a client side mod or 2 as well server side to help manage the server and make the gameplay more enjoyable. 

## When will the server be up?  

First Quarter of 2020. We don't have an exact date as we still have to purchase hardware, do testing and configuration for the launch. 

## What will the server Specs Be?

#### Still under development. But we are planning the following:

- AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 3.8 GHz 12-Core Processor
- Asus Prime X470-Pro ATX AM4 Motherboard
- G.Skill Aegis 64 GB (4 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory
- XPG GAMMIX 2TB S11 Pro 3D NAND PCIe NVMe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 R/W up to 3500/3000MB SSD
- Corsair VS 650 W 80+ Certified ATX Power Supply
- Rosewill RSV-R4100-4U Rackmount Server Case/Chassis - 8 Internal Bays
- As well as Backup Sata Mechanical Drive for longer term backups. 

## Can I donate Towards the New Server & Hardware?

That would be amazing. You can imagine the above specs are a bit costly so every little bit helps. My paypal information is kanechart@gmail.com and I thank you so much ahead of time!
